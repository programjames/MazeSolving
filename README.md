# Path Finding Algorithms
This uses two algorithms to solve mazes. The common A* algorithm, and a backwards breadth first search algorithm that I will refer to as C* from now on (C* for Camacho).

I have included several visuals within the code that rely on pygame and numpy to run (as well as the standard libraries random and time), however the functions a_star and c_star do not utilize any external packages.

To install pygame and numpy, the following commands can often be run on the terminal:
```
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```
If this doesn't work, then try using the methods found on [pygame's website](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) and [scipy's website](https://scipy.org/install.html) to install them.
