# MazeSolving
This utilizes two algorithms, A* and my own C*, to solve a maze.

To run, use Python 3+ with the pygame and numpy packages installed. This can often be done with the commands
```
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```
If this doesn't work, then try using these methods to install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) and [numpy](https://scipy.org/install.html).
